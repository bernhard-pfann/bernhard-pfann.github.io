## [Project 1: Tackling the UNO Card Game with Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/bernhard-pfann/uno-card-game_rl)
- Created a game engine of the UNO card game from scratch
- Obtained game statistics from simulating a series of 100,000 games
- Implemented Reinforcement Learning agent (Q-Learning, Monte Carlo) in order to discover an optimal game strategy
- [Published article](https://bernhard-pfann.medium.com/tackling-uno-card-game-with-reinforcement-learning-fad2fc19355c)

## [Project 3: Predictive Yield Curve Modeling](https://github.com/bernhard-pfann/pca-yield-curve-analytics)
The aim of this project is to study the yield curve dynamics in reduced dimensionality by leveraging principal components analysis (PCA).<br><br>

- Applied PCA to government yield curve data from ECB (2005-2019)
- Contrasted PC's with the traditional factors "level", "slope", "curvature"
- Evaluated the goodness of fit for strongest PC's over time
- Tested short-term predictability of PC's with autoregressive time series model and ensemble model
